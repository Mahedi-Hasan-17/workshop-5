        <p>Talipam is one of the endangered plants in Bangladesh. Its scientific name is <i> Corypha taliera Roxb</i>.
         After 1979, the talipam tree located in the Dhaka University area was the only wild talipam tree 
         in the world. Talipam produces flowers and fruits only once in its life and later dies. The Dhaka 
         tree also became extinct in 2012 after producing flowers and fruits in 2010.</p>

        <p>The Dead Sea (Hebrew: יָם הַמֶּלַח‎ About this soundYam ha-Melah lit. Sea of Salt; Arabic: البحر الميت‎
           About this soundAl-Bahr al-Mayyit, lit. the Dead Sea, or Buhayrat, Bahret or Birket Lut, lit. 
           "Lake/Sea of Lot") is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and the West Bank to 
           the west. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River. The lake's 
           surface is 430.5 metres (1,412 ft) below sea level, making its shores the lowest land-based elevation
            on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342 
            g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water  9.6 times as salty as the 
            ocean and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating.This salinity makes 
            for a harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, 
            northern basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point. 
            The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean Basin for thousands of years.
             It was one of the world's first health resorts (for Herod the Great), and it has been the supplier
              of a wide variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. 
              Today, tourists visit the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines. The Palestinian 
              tourism industry has been met with setbacks in developing along the West Bank coast. The Dead 
            Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050
             km2 (410 sq mi) in 1930. The recession of the Dead Sea has begun causing problems, and multiple 
            canal and pipeline proposals have been made to reduce its recession. One of these proposals is the 
            Red Sea . Dead Sea Water Conveyance pipeline project, which would provide water to neighbouring countries
             and carry brine to the Dead Sea to help stabilise its water level.</p>

            <p>The Sundarbans Reserve Forest (SRF), located in the south-west of Bangladesh between the river Baleswar 
                in the East and the Harinbanga in the West, adjoining to the Bay of Bengal, is the largest contiguous 
                mangrove forest in the world. Lying between latitude 21° 27′ 30″ and 22° 30′ 00″ North and longitude 89° 
                0″ and 90° 00′ 00″ East and with a total area of 10,000 km2, 60% of the property lies in Bangladesh and 
                the rest in India. The land area, including exposed sandbars, occupies 414,259 ha (70%) with water bodies 
                covering 187,413 ha (30%).The three wildlife sanctuaries in the south cover an area of 139,700 ha and are 
                considered core breeding areas for a number of endangered species. Situated in a unique bioclimatic zone 
                within a typical geographical situation in the coastal region of the Bay of Bengal, it is a landmark of 
                ancient heritage of mythological and historical events. Bestowed with magnificent scenic beauty and 
                natural resources, it is internationally recognized for its high biodiversity of mangrove flora and 
                fauna both on land and water. The immense tidal mangrove forests of Bangladeshs’ Sundarbans Forest Reserve,
                 is in reality a mosaic of islands of different shapes and sizes, perennially washed by brackish water 
                shrilling in and around the endless and mind-boggling labyrinths of water channels. The site supports 
                exceptional biodiversity in its terrestrial, aquatic and marine habitats; ranging from micro to macro 
                flora and fauna. The Sundarbans is of universal importance for globally endangered species including the 
                Royal Bengal Tiger, Ganges and Irawadi dolphins, estuarine crocodiles and the critically endangered 
                endemic river terrapin (Batagur baska).  It is the only mangrove habitat in the world for Panthera tigris 
                tigris species.</p>
